**customer-churn-prediction**

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using Machine Learning techniques. 
By identifying customers who are likely to leave, businesses can take proactive actions to improve customer retention, 
reduce revenue loss, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

**Dataset used**
- <a href="https://github.com/VimalKumar-03/customer-churn-prediction/blob/main/Customer-churn-dataset.csv">Dataset</a>

### ðŸ”„ Process
- **Data Collection** â€“ Imported the dataset and understood its structure.  
- **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handled missing values, duplicates, outliers, and encoded categorical variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualized churn patterns, correlations, and customer behavior trends.  
- **Feature Engineering** â€“ Created and selected important features for better model performance.  
- **Model Building** â€“ Applied ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
- **Model Evaluation** â€“ Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- **Result Interpretation** â€“ Identified key factors influencing customer churn.  
- **Conclusion** â€“ Provided insights and recommendations for reducing churn.
